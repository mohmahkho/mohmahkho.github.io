I'm a third-year PhD student in theoretical computer science at Simon Fraser University (SFU) where I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by [Igor Shinkar](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ishinkar/). Prior to SFU, I obtained my BSc at K. N. Toosi University of Technology (KNTU) in computer engineering.

I am interested in various areas of theoretical computer science, such as pseudorandomness, analysis of Boolean functions, interactive proofs, and learning theory.
